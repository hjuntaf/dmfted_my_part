# dmfted_my_part
Major parts of my contributions are included.

All the cpp contributions ("*.cpp" except "run_*.cpp", and cpp-codes in files) are written by Hyeong Jun Lee.

The original main code ("run.c") is first created by Ara Go and modified by Ara Go and Hyeong Jun Lee.

Variations of the main code for Bethe lattice calculations and/or symmetry considerations ("run_*") are written by Hyeong Jun Lee based on the original main code.

One postprocessing code for moment calculations ("moment.c") is written by Hyeong Jun Lee.
